# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

Implemented using Unity and C#.

Currently, the following algorithms are implemented:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort

Due to my limited understanding of how Coroutines work in Unity, I had to implement the sorting algorithms in one function.
